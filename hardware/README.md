# Hardware
These are the 3D printable parts. Both STL and Fusion360 files are available for ease of modification.

# Printing Guide
All measurements for the design of FlexiaGloves were based off the size of a single hand, however all hands are different; More than likely every part of the glove will need to be tailored the size of the target hand.

## Sizing
### Finger Guides
The length of each finger guide should be configured to match length of each segment of the target fingers. The width of the guide should be adjusted to accommodate the size of the homemade flex sensors.

### Baseplate
The length, width, finger spacing, and wrist width of the baseplate should be configured to be comfortable on the target hand.

### Force Feed Back Module
The length of each module should be configured to accommodate the total range of motion for each finger. The back portion of the module can be extended or shrunk based on the length of spring wire that is required.
